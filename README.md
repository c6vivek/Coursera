# Coursera-nodejs
Practice exercises from Coursera

# Course information
This repository has follow along code for the **"[Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs/)"** on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
The course is being taught by Jogesh K. Muppala. 

# Repository information
The repository contains all of the code required for the course (including the assignments). I have tried to keep all commits in sequence to the lectures. The aim is to help anyone who wants to do a crash course on react (like I wanted to). Please use the code only for your reference and not to pass the assignments (the best way to learn is writing code yourself).
The code only gives one of the ways to finish assignments, and you can come up with your own and more efficient way to. If the repository does help you in some way, please mark a star for feedback :)

The packages used in the project might be slightly different from the ones used in the course, but should still work good.

## Note
The code is only upto Week 3 of the course. I plan to finish week 4 sometime in the future.
